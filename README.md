# hot-springs-delta

https://westcoasthotsprings.vercel.app/

This is an informational and psuedo social network site about camping/hot springs along the west coast. 
Hopefully to help some folks plan a trip or provide information on an excursion.

# Stack Used
The project uses a database in mongodb I made with information gathered across many sources.
It is built using a react client-side framework with bootstrap for styling and #expressjs back-end.

# Lessons Learned
1) First thing that helped me was keeping small manageable goals in mind. Tackling one issue at a time. 
This reduced the feeling of being overwhelmed and kept me motivated to learn one thing after another.
2) Something else I learned was keeping the scale of the project reasonable. 
To get this project finished I had to keep it small and simple and add onto it as I went. Since I was learning a lot of tech, 
making things more complex could easily spiral out of control.
